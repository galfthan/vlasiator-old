README file for vlasiator test package


The test package can be used to compare Vlasiator to reference runs,
in order to see if results have changed. It does not look at physical
quantities, it is purely a tool for tracking changes in results.


Please read https://github.com/fmihpc/vlasiator/wiki/Test-package for further instructions.
