  these lists, then they should be updated using
  updateRemoteVelocityBlockLists() before calling this function.

  This function will update the global view of the block-structure so that it is consistent and up-to-date on all processes:  
  - Computes which blocks have contents according to threshold
  - Adds/keeps blocks if they have content, or if their neighbors in spatial or velocity space have contents
  - Removes blocks which do not fulfill above mentioned criteria
  - Updates velocity block lists of remote cells using updateRemoteVelocityBlockLists(). Note that data in blocks is not transferred!
  - Updates movers so that their block-dependent internal datastructures are up-to-date, if reInitMover is true.
